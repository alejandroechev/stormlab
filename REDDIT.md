## Post 1: r/civilengineering

**Title:** I built a free, browser-based stormwater modeling tool (TR-55, pond routing) — no install needed

**Body:**

I built StormLab, a free browser-based stormwater modeling tool.

It does TR-55 hydrology (SCS runoff, curve numbers, Type I/IA/II/III distributions), unit hydrographs, and Modified Puls pond routing. You build your watershed as a visual DAG — subcatchments, ponds, reaches, junctions — and it solves the whole system.

No install, no login, no subscription. Just open the URL and start modeling.

Still early but functional. Would love feedback from practicing engineers — what features would make this actually useful for your day-to-day work?

## Post 2: r/hydrology

**Title:** Free browser tool for TR-55 hydrology and pond routing — looking for feedback

**Body:**

I built a free web app called StormLab that does SCS/TR-55 runoff calculations, unit hydrograph generation, and Modified Puls pond routing — all in the browser with a visual node-based editor.

You can define subcatchments with curve numbers, connect them through reaches and ponds, and get routed hydrographs at any point. Supports all four NRCS rainfall distributions.

No install, no account, works on any device. Open source too.

Would love to hear from hydrologists — what's missing? What would make you actually use this over your current tools?

## Post 3: r/engineering

**Title:** I'm building free browser-based alternatives to expensive engineering desktop software — here's StormLab for stormwater modeling

**Body:**

I've been building a suite of free, open-source engineering tools that run entirely in the browser. The latest is StormLab — a stormwater modeling tool that does TR-55 hydrology and pond routing with a drag-and-drop diagram editor.

The goal is to provide modern browser-based tools that are free and easy to use. No login, no install, no data leaves your browser.

Feedback welcome — especially on what features civil/water resources engineers need most.
